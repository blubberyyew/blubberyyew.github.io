# Gaming News Repository
If you didn't know, I have a second repository, titled "Gaming News". It is mainly used as a source of news to gamers that like websites related to Kotaku or Polygon. Of course, you do not have to join in, but I am really excited for this program. Join this repository [here](https://github.com/blubberyyew/Gaming-News). Anyone can edit this, but I want approval.
